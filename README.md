# python-data-analysis-notebooks
Python for data analysis, visualization, and EDA using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib
This repository contains exercises and assignments from a course focused on applying Python programming, data analysis, and visualization techniques to real-world datasets

Python Programming: Control flow, functions, and modular coding

Data Manipulation: Using NumPy and Pandas for cleaning, transforming, and analyzing datasets

Data Visualization: Building scatter plots, histograms, and multi-dimensional visualizations using Matplotlib

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Computing descriptive statistics, distributions, and correlations

Database Querying: Fetching and integrating data from external sources

Reproducible Research: Using Jupyter Notebooks for analysis and documentation

# Final Project: Galaxy Dataset Analysis
Analyzed a dataset of 27,000 simulated galaxies from the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation. The project involved:

Data Cleaning & Exploration: Checked missing values, computed ranges, and summarized key statistics

## Visualization:

2D density map of galaxy positions to reveal large-scale structures (cosmic web)

Scatter plots and 2D histograms showing relationships between properties (e.g., dark matter mass vs. stellar mass, metallicity vs. radius)

Histograms comparing distributions across subsets (e.g., baryonic fraction, star formation rates)

Subsetting & Comparative Analysis: Defined subsets based on baryonic fraction and star formation rates, then compared size and metallicity trends

Reflection on Findings: Interpreted correlations and anomalies in galaxy properties
